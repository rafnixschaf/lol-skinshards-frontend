# Lolskinshards Frontend


A **small proof of concept** to display, filter, and search **League of Legends skin shards** more efficiently.  
The official client UI is too minimal once you have 100+ shards and want to decide which to **buy** or **reroll**.

This app uses the **local League Client API** that the LoL client itself communicates with.

> Backend currently retrieves credentials **only on macOS**.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
